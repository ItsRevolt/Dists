I know the way code flows is stupid.

How it is now:
index => login => send client and prefix to init via params(note to self: fix, its easy) => init receives, proceeds to load commands, imported manually
|
|
=> if first run, then call cli, else call login

How it should be:
index and login merged => replace init with auto command loader, directory based(?)
|
| instead of shit being passed by params, have a helper js file with exports
